Lightweight app for ingesting IOT sensor data (specifically from Blues Wireless hardware) and notifying via SMS. This was built with the intention of being agnostic to the sensor source and to easily scale as more sensors are added. At the moment, it's built specifically around the blues.io ecosystem and [link]deta.sh[link] - but will eventually be generecized.
